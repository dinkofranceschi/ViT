# Deformable ViT
Applying deformable multiheadattention to ViT architecture


To-do list:

- [x] Finishing the logging code and wandb logging
- [x] Implementing timm versions (performer and transformer for 224x224 16-patch-size images) 
- [ ] Code and test deformable attention
- [ ] Code and test locality-aware initialization
- [ ] Code and test DeBERTa attention
- [ ] Implement performer in the above
- [ ] Usage
